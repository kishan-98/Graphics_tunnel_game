# Tunnel Rush with Shaders

Games are amazing to play with novel ideas and even better with better graphics. This game is simple with player to move across the tunnel and avoid hitting by the obstacles. Toggling through the different shader and texture would enable you to grasp the importance of `graphical properties` of the gameplay.
